[JacketedHollowPoint]
Description=Jacketed hollow point ammunition is characterized by its hollow tip which initiates uniform expansion of the bullet tip to the depth of the hollow point.  This expansion causes severe internal damage to the target with less penetration.  JHP ammo is best used against unarmored targets since it causes maximum damage with less chance of penetration which could cause unwanted targets to be hit.
