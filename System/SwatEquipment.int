[Taser]
Description=The Taser stun gun works on the principal of Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD).  It fires small electrodes into the target and then sends a powerful electric charge down the thin wires.  The EMD effect causes involuntary contraction of the target's muscle tissue regardless of an individual's pain tolerance or mental focus.  The effect is painful and demoralizing to even the most aggressive suspects.||The Taser has two key drawbacks.  The first is that it has a relatively short range.  The second is that new electrodes must be loaded after each shot.
FriendlyName=Taser Stun Gun

[Stingray]
Description=The Cobra is a dual-purpose less-lethal weapon. It fires small electrodes into the target and then sends a powerful electric charge down thin wires still connected to the hand unit. The electrical discharge causes involuntary contraction of the target's muscle tissue, regardless of an individual's pain tolerance or mental focus.  The effect is painful and demoralizing to even the most aggressive suspects. It has a longer range than its Taser forebearer, and can fire darts in groups of four or two separate groups of two. It can also be used in touch-stun mode as a melee weapon. An onboard computer records information on shock intensity and duration, among other factors.
FriendlyName=Cobra Stun Gun

FriendlyName=5.7x28mm Submachine Gun

FriendlyName=Colt Accurized Rifle

[DesertEagleHG]

FriendlyName=Remington 700 Sniper rifle

[C2Charge]
Description=The C2 breaching charge is a powerful and devastating method of breaching a door.  The compact and specially designed charge destroys the locking mechanism of the door and forcefully opens the door at the same time.  The noise and shock of the detonation causes people on the opposite side of the door to react in a similar manner to a flashbang detonation, which can provide a tactical advantage for using it instead of the breaching shotgun.  The C2 breaching charge is an explosive and can injure or kill anyone unlucky enough to be directly behind the door.
FriendlyName=C2 (x3)

[MP5SMG]
Description=This 9mm sub-machine gun is designed by a world renowned german manufacturer.  It is preferred by many para-military groups throughout the world for urban tactical engagements.

This model is equipped with a fire mode selector allowing semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes.
FriendlyName=.45 SMG

[M4A1MG]
Description=The Colt M4A1 carbine is based on the tried and true design of the M16 assault rifle used by the United States Army.

It is equipped with a fire mode selector allowing semi-automatic as well as fully automatic firing.

FriendlyName=9mm Handgun

[Wedge]
Description=This specially designed tactical wedge is slid under the door and then activated.  The spring loaded action flips up wedges preventing the door from opening from either direction.  The rubber coating along the bottom of the wedge increases friction making it extremely difficult to push open with brute force.  It can only be removed with a cutting tool reducing the risk of a suspect dislodging the device.
FriendlyName=Door Wedge

[Optiwand]
Description=The opti-wand is a sophisticated observation device which allows officers to examine situations around corners and under closed doors without exposing themselves to lines of fire.

It is an invaluable tool for gathering intelligence on suspect and civilian locations before performing dangerous clear routines and potentially exposing your team to fire.
FriendlyName=Optiwand

[PepperSpray]
Description=While generally used for riot control, handheld pepper spray canisters can be an effective tool for subduing uncooperative targets.  The active ingredient in pepper spray is Oleoresin Capsicum or OC.  OC is an inflammatory agent that causes the eyes to swell up and close.  It also causes a burning sensation on any exposed skin.  Due to its limited range and area of effect it is best used in addition to other non-lethal devices to cause a suspect or hostage to comply.
FriendlyName=Pepper Spray

[stingGrenade]
Description=The sting grenade, or Stinger, is filled with many small rubber balls.  Upon detonation these balls are ejected from the grenade, bombarding targets with blunt force projectiles.  The rubber balls will not penetrate the skin but can cause dizzyness, disorientation, and severe pain from the impact of the projectiles.  While considered less lethal, the sting grenade can cause severe injury if it detonates in very close proximity to someone.
FriendlyName=Stinger

[CSGasGrenade]
Description=This grenade emits Chlorobenzylidene malonitrile, or CS.  CS is a chemical agent which causes tearing in the eyes and irritation of the mucus membranes.

While under the influence of tear gas, suspects are at a significant disadvantage when encountering officers.
FriendlyName=CS Gas

[FlashbangGrenade]
Description=The flashbang is a diversionary device that stuns and disorients people with an explosive report and a brillant flash.  People that are affected by the device can be temporarily blinded and deafened by the blast.  During this time SWAT has a significant tactical advantage over the affected persons.||Flashbangs are designed so that they will not fragment on detonation, but can still cause serious injury if detonation occurs in close proximity to a person.  Caution is advised.
FriendlyName=Flashbang

[BreachingSG]
Description=The breaching shotgun is a specially modified, pump action shotgun designed to breach locked doors.  The weapon fires frangible breaching ammo that is designed to quickly break into very small pieces upon impact.  This behavior reduces penetration and increases damage upon impact with hard surfaces.  These factors make it ideal for breaking locks on doors without penetrating the door and harming someone on the other side.  The toothed extender on barrel allows officers to jam the weapon into the door and ensures the correct distance from the lock for the breaching ammo to be most effective.  Its compact design permits officers to carry the weapon on their back, allowing it to be carried in addition to the primary weapon.
FriendlyName=Shotgun
